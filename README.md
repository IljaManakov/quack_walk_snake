This repository contains a slide deck in the form of a Jupyter notebook.
To run the presentation you need install the dependencies in requirements.txt, start a jupyter server and finally enter presentation mode (Alt+R, there is also a button in the main bar).
The presentation mixes in interactive code that is expected to be executed as part of the presentation. To make everything run correctly you need to execute the two cells containing function definitions **before** starting the presentation.
